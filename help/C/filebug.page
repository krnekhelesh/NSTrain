<title>File a bug</title>
<p>NSTrain is my personal project which I will continue to work on in my spare time. It is an open source project meaning you are welcome to look at the source 
code and try to improve it. If you notice an issue, please file a bug report at GitHub <link href="https://github.com/krnekhelesh/NSTrain/issues">here</link>.</p>

<p>GitHub is a one stop place to manage code, bug reports, project wiki and many other functions. In order to report bugs, you need to create a GitHub account. This 
is extremely easy and free.</p>

<p>Follow the following steps to report a bug against NSTrain,</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Register for an account on <link href="https://github.com/">Github</link>, if you don't already have one.</p></item>
  <item><p>Search for similar bugs. If a similar bug report exists add any additional information you think might be missing.</p></item>
  <item><p>Otherwise proceed to create a new bug report. Try to provide as much information as possible to help the developer fix the issue.</p></item>
  <item><p>Monitor the issue and respond to any questions asked by the developer. By default any new update on the bug report should send a email notification</p></item>
