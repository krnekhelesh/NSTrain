<title>How can I contribute?</title>
<p>NSTrain is an open source application and my personal project. Any help to making it better is much appreciated. The most basic way of contributing to NSTrain 
is by submitting bug reports. We want to ensure that NSTrain performs its functions properly. It is better to have one feature that works perfectly than a multitude 
of features which do not work.</p>

<p>If you are interested you could have a look at our <link href="https://github.com/krnekhelesh/NSTrain/wiki">wiki</link> to look at our upcoming features which are 
in development and help me build it. You can otherwise help test beta builds to see if they work properly.</p>
